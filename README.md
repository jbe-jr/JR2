# Vanguard Digital Advisor

## Overview and Origin 

Vanguard is an investment/mutual fund firm that began in 1975, unique in it’s founding-vision of operating as a client-owned mutual fund company, with no outside ownership. They emphasize low costs by keeping their focus on the customer as a product of healthy leadership collaboration.

* Name of company

Vanguard

* When was the company incorporated?

1975

* Who are the founders of the company?

John C. Bogle

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founding idea for the fund began as a strategy to focus the ownership of a mutual fund company on the clients, rather than being owned from outside funding sources.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

In 1929, the Vanguard Wellington Fund, which at the time was called Industrial and Power Securities Company, served as one of the few surviving funds to withstand the great depression, which began just months after the fund’s founding. In 1975, John C. Bogle lead opening operations of the company which was opened as a new type of firm with a simplified name, Vanguard. The company received funding in the beginning from investors/clients/consumers seeking a stable storage of their finances/wealth at a time of uncertainty in the leading months before the war. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company is trying to solve the problem of increasing competition in the rapidly changing financial landscape, particularly the advancement of technology in the investment industry. To keep up with this ever-growing problem/demand, the company began operating a robo-advising service by the name of Vanguard Digital Advisor.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

The big niche seems to be targeting people from younger age groups such as early adulthood through middle adulthood in their 40’s, but the market has seen growth in all ranges because of technological adaptations by other competitors and startups alike. For Vanguard and their Digital Advisor product specifically, their target market are the millennials and Gen Z generations, as their average client age in 2020 was 37 years old. In comparison, their hybrid advisor system comprising of a combination of both human and robo-advising, has an average client age 20 years higher at 57 years old.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

With the up-and-coming technological services and products in the robo-advising space, there is an ever-increasing urgency of opportunity to move forward, as those companies with larger resources and capabilities to innovate will continue to evolve with the market, those limited in their outreach and funding will suffer. Vanguard is a historical company with infrastructure all over the world, which carries with it countless advantages over most startup companies in terms of outreach. They are more established, with more infrastructure, in more locations. However, other investing giants such as Goldman Sachs and Charles Schwab have all launched or are in the process of implementing similar services, each focusing on specific corners of the robo-advising customer base through "niches".

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The specific technology utilized to build and run the robo-advising software product seems to be comprised of a combination of machine learning A. I. and large quantities of data and data analysis capabilities on a large scale. Also, extensive historical data gathered by Vanguard specifically, may provide them a slight edge over newer companies and startups.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

There are over 200 robo-advisers in the U. S. alone, and competition has evolved to require niches in which to survive the market consolidation. The company is an incumbent company which adopted technological innovations to update its product offerings.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The first robo-advisors were launched in 2008 while the financial crisis of rampant mortgage loans gripped the market. This led to a popularity surge in personal financial management. The first public application launched in the U. S. in 2008 by the name of Betterment, giving an industrial tool via a cutting edge, program application or "app" to the individual investor. By the end of 2015, 100 robo-advisers were managing $60 Billion dollars in assets across the world. By the end of 2020 there were more than 300 robo-advisers worldwide managing close to $1.4 trillion in assets, with that figure projected to climb to $2.5 trillion by 2023, and close to $6.2 trillion U. S. dollars in assets by 2027. It is clear that with the rapid accessibility of information, as well as advances in computational technology, coupled with technological financial ingenuity, the ceiling for robo-advising has been rising along with the other branches of finance.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Betterment, Wealthfront, Personal Capital, SoFi, Stash, Axos Invest, Ally Invest, SigFig, and Blooom are some of the more focused competitors to Vanguard Digital Advisor in the robo-advising industry.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

While Vanguard has historical presence and validity; in the growing robo-advising space, it has transformed into one of the most capable companies in the robo-advising space because of its grand reach and willingness to invest and develop the technology necessary at a competitive pace. It has accomplished combining the prestige of the Vanguard brand with the new-age technology of robo-advising.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? 

The core metrics used to determine success in this space are the average rate of returns for all accounts, total assets managed, and fees required to use/participate in the product. These can include account minimum, availability of human advisors, investment package, fees, portfolio rebalancing, account types, portfolio choice, and finally investment performance.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Out of 20 top similar robo-advising services from 20 different companies, Vanguard ranked right in the middle of the pack with an annualized rate of return of 3.42% over a two- and half-year span between Dec 31st, 2017 and June 30th, 2020. The lowest return percentage was 0.81% while the highest was 4.71%. Though it does hold the top spot in the world as of January 31st, 2021 for the largest amount of AUM (assets under management) for a robo-advisor at an amount of $231 billion.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

Because Vanguard seems to have such a wide range of products, one of the only aspects they could perhaps focus on is the presentation of their products. Because they are a historical institution, they may not feel as pressured to change their longstanding theme to keep up with the changes of today’s market. As for their product specifically, Digital Advisor can perhaps offer 5-10 robo-advised investing strategies that the client may choose from which all focus on different industries and situations for the market, based on the robo-advisor’s recommendations.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would further give the client a sense of choice while still allowing the robo-advisor to perform its task. It would attract a new age of investors who are looking more and more into automation in all aspects of their lives, including their investment practices. This would expand the potential customer base of the company for it’s product/service.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The technologies needed for this new feature or “product offering” would be the same ones that the company uses for the current Digital Advisor model which include machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and cloud computing. However, it can also analyze data to identify effective customer-interaction features found in other applications throughout and outside the financial technology field.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The technologies are appropriate for the solution because they encompass the necessary capabilities to carry out the task at hand. First, the machine learning program can be designed using the cloud-computing infrastructure to collect and analyze data relevant to the portfolio/client’s needs, then the artificial intelligence or software program will be responsible for managing the actual execution.
